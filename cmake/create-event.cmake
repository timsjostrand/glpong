#
# Helper for doing the glue code involved in binding events to a specific
# C-function for use in 'events.c'.
#
# Example:
#
# create_event("sound_play", "sound_play_buf_detailed")
#
# Will look up the function "sound_play_buf_detailed" in "sound.h" and produce
# the necessary glue code to bind it to an event called "sound_play" in
# "events_generated.c"

# Queues an event with the specified 'event_name' bound to the C-function
# 'event_func' to be created once "events_generated.c" is built.
